                        <h3>2. Agent Smith - The Matrix</h3>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Agent Smith is a major villain in "The Matrix" series, representing the machines' control over humans. At first, he's just a program meant to keep order in the Matrix, but he starts to question his own role and reality. His struggle with his identity and purpose becomes a big theme, especially as he gains more independence and power. Smith's character explores ideas about control, free will, and the ethics of artificial intelligence. His change from a simple agent to a complex, almost human-like being, dealing with his own existence, makes him one of the most intriguing villian/tyrant in sci-fi.

                        <br />
                        <p>
                            President Snow is the harsh ruler of Panem. His rule is all about manipulation, fear, and stopping any rebellion. Snow's main dilemma is keeping control and power over the districts. He has to balance looking kind while using brutal methods to stop any opposition. His complicated relationship with Katniss Everdeen, the rebellion's symbol, makes him face his own weaknesses and the limits of his power. Snow's character looks at themes of tyranny, power abuse, and how far a leader will go to stay in control, even if it costs him his humanity.
