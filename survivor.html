                            Ellen Ripley is one of the toughest survivor characters ever. She faces scary aliens and manages to outsmart them with her smarts and determination. In "Aliens," she has to decide whether to blow up the alien nest, which could kill a bunch of alien eggs but also risk the lives of the people there, including a young girl named Newt whom she really cares about. This decision is super hard for her because she wants to protect Newt but also knows she has to stop the aliens.
