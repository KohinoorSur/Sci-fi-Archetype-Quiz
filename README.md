# Sci-fi-Archetype-Quiz
It's a fun and interactive quiz to determine your sci-fi archetype. Options are very limited so not the most accurate but it provides some very fun dilemmas for users to hurt their brain over.

Purpose: This was created as a final project for my APCSP class. It basically gives you scenarios that are moral dilemmas you have to choose from, and quiz takers are challenged to make tough decisions and given a custom webpage that devles into movie charatcers who are that certain archetype, there's infomration about thier moral dilemmas. The basic idea when making it was to make people a little uncomfortable with the choices they make.
